MUTANST
=======

This repository contains the [Python source code][] for the text generator which
produced the text on page 24 of [SPECULATIVE FICTIONS ISSUE ONE][], as well as
the [original generated output][] of that generator, with its original
formatting.

It also contains an [8-bit BASIC version][] of the generator.  In theory, this
is the same algorithm, simply implemented in a different language.  In practice,
the two generators produce different output â€” probably due to a "desirable bug"
somewhere in the Python version.

The Python version was written either in late 2013 or early 2014; the BASIC
version was written in November 2014 (during NaNoGenMo, but not submitted for
it.)
